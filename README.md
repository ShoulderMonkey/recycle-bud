# RecycleBud

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

This is a monorepo project handled by NX, Frontend Angular, Backend NestJS, Database Postgres.

A demo project to showcase a possible recycling app with private/public jwt user authentication.
Key tyechnology features: 

-A seeder Module to automatically insert base data, for now there is a system user to access the system with email: sys, password: sys.

-Secure authentication module that uses Passport, and protects all routes.

-Base Controller and Service: these base classes enables to create basic crud routes passing an entity class in input. Both in backend and frontend to match the communication between the two.

-Database communication using TypeORM.

## Quick start

Just run this command to install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

In case you need to recreate private and public keys: navigate to folder 'server/src/assets/keys' and run following commands

```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 && openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

To configure postgres database, you can create an admin user :recycle-bud, password: password and create a database with name: recycle-bud and owner the user just created. You can also change database configuration to point to your own database modifying the .env file.

To run the application following commands: 

Frontend

```
npm run client
```

Backend

```
npm run server
```

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
